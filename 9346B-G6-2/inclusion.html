				<h3>PWD</h3>
				<p> The Barangay Officials stated that there is only one identified under the PWD. The individual stated by the Barangay officials has moved into a different place so as of the moment there is no longer stated under PWD. But the Barangay officials stated that during the time when the PWD is located in the area of ambiong, the individual received a help from the barangay to continue his studies. The PWD's are not under of Barangay's care but instead they always redirect PWDs to the government because barangay officials doesn't receive any subsidy from the government. But Recently, Baguio City urged to create PWD affairs office. THE creation of a Persons with Disabilities Affairs Office (PDAO) in Baguio City was underscored during the city’s celebration of the 2017 National Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation and White Cane Safety Week.
