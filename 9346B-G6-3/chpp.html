				<p> "During the olden times, before Baguio City was discovered by the American expeditionary, the place has no name yet. 
				The area was very much covered by thick forests and moss where wild animals, together with wild bees frequented. 
				Among the bee species, there was a certain sort of bees called "Ambiongan" (in Ibaloi dialect).
				This group of bees tunneled deep in the fertile earth of the forests and thereby manufactured their sweet and precious honeys.
				The group of bees is very secretive and are powerful killers whenever they get disturbed.
				The witty story about the bees even reached the people in the lowlands; so the lowlanders came hiking just to witness the bees first-hand.
				Together with the locals, the far-off lowlanders searched for the Ambiongan bees.
				True enough, the visitors were able to find the bees but found no track of their precious honeys." </p>
				<p> "Another reason for the locals' high value for the Ambiongan bees' honeys is the honeys' use in community feasts.
				The locals offer these honeys aside from the local wine called "Tapey" to every visitor who joins them in their celebrations.
				Nevertheless, as these visitors came to the place, they often asked the name of the place and the locals did not provide answer to their queries yet, not until one time during a big feast of Pangat, a native of the place.
				There, Pangat declared that their place must then forth be called Ambiong in remembrance of the precious Ambiongan bees." (Taken from: Ambiong-Baguio Barangay Document) </p>
